# Zonn Privacy Policy

Last updated: January 2026

## Overview
Zonn is a focus timer application that helps you maintain productivity through timed focus sessions.

## Data Collection
Zonn collects and stores the following data **locally on your device only**:
- Focus session timestamps
- Session durations
- Custom session labels you create

## Data Storage
All data is stored locally on your Mac using Apple's SwiftData framework. **No data is transmitted to external servers.** Your focus session history never leaves your device.

## Third-Party Services
Zonn integrates with Spotify via Apple's automation framework (AppleScript) to control playback during focus sessions. This integration:
- Does not share any personal data with Spotify
- Only sends playback commands (play/pause)
- Loads album artwork images from Spotify's public CDN for display purposes

## Data Retention
All session data remains on your device until you choose to delete it. Uninstalling the app removes all stored data.

## Children's Privacy
Zonn does not knowingly collect data from children under 13.

## Changes to This Policy
We may update this privacy policy from time to time. Changes will be posted on this page.
